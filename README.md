# Welcome to R
This repository is a collection of code written for my module on Descriptive Analytics with R.

## How do I use it?
Navigate to the Assignment folder to view the latest R files added.

The `RMD` files detail the R codes wrote in reponse to the questions found in the `docx` files for the respective assignments.

Hope it helps!
