# Welcome to R
In this repository, you may find a collection of R code written for the following module I have taken in NUS:

``DBA3702 Descriptive Analytics with R``

This course introduces the basics of R, a powerful analytics environment, to organize, visualize, and analyse data, and uses case studies to teach students on how to analyse and summarise data and present findings in a structured, meaningful, and convincing way

## How do I use it?
To seek inspiration for analytical approaches to data science problems in R, please navigate to the Assignment folder to view the latest R files added.


The `RMD` files detail the R codes written in reponse to the questions found in the `docx` files for the respective assignments.
A ``HTML`` file has also been compiled for each assignment for ease of viewing.


Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn if you would like further clarifications/assistance!

Otherwise, hope it helps!
